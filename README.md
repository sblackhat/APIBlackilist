# APIBlackilist
This is a simple program with a humble interface that receives as input a wireshark capture and analyzes all the IPs contained using
an API. The program request the webpage https://signals.api.auth0.com/ for the information of these IPs and writes the information 
only of the malicious IPs into a txt file.

The app does not work unless you provide your own API key that you can find in this webpage https://auth0.com/

This application is not finished so feel free to add changes and play with it.
